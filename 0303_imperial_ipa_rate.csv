T-Minimal yet bitter bite, slight crisp sweetness. Grainy and floral flavor throughout. Peppery bite. Some strawberry, blueberry and apple as well. Fresh.
F-Crisp, light and bubbly mouthfeel. Very light. Refreshing.
O-A damn good and perfectly crafted ipa. I can see how this is world class. Incredibly fresh and refreshing from end to end. Articulate flavor profile. Rewarding to drink.

Taste is well balanced - aroma is enhanced just before tasting with biscuit/herbal/floral notes, taste is citric rind/pith, floral, herbal notes, then biscuit/oaty note, lighter sweet malt.

189,UWDAWG,Washington,4.03,2024-01-08,"Poured from a 12 ounce can with a best by date of 2-15-24 at 52 degrees in a snifter.

Look- Medium amber, very slight haze, light tan frothy head, above average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Biscuit, grapefruit, pine, honey, medium strength of scent.

Taste- Grapefruit, biscuit, honey, slight pine, moderately sweet, highly astringent, high strength of flavor.

Feel- Full body, slightly below average carbonation, highly creamy, highly bitter, slightly mouth warming, highly astringent.

Overall- The medium amber color was the first indication this was going to be a malt forward beer. The above average head retention and lacing helped to keep the look number at 4. The bouquet was definitely malt forward with grapefruit as a strong secondary aroma. The flavor was malt forward and pleasant right up until the astringency got in the way. The flavor rating would definitely have been higher without the astringency. The feel with full body and high creaminess was outstanding, but the astringency once again held my rating down by overshadowing the positive attributes. Overall this was a solid beer that was just too malt forward and astringent for my taste.

That’s not an honest way to distribute beer cause of environmental affects that make the beer lose its taste. The average rookie consumer will not be able to judge to buy the beer or not. My two six packs were poured out and 40 bucks went down the drain too. Bought in November with the carton saying best by January 24 th. Guess what the bottom of the can revealed? January 2036.

Aroma is resinous and piney; sweet bready malt and I’d guess mostly Simcoe, Centennial, and Amarillo hops in abundance. Some grapefruit rind. 

Taste is a blast of sweet fruity malt and resinous, citrusy hops. Honey evident. Lots of pine, grapefruit, hop oils. Then more resin and pine. Some alcohol. Intense. This beer just grabs your palate by the throat and takes no prisoners. 

Mouthfeel is full-bodied, chewy, slick. Tongue-coating. Sticks with you. 

Overall I’d consider this a “statement” beer. It’s strong, bold, unapologetic. Still it manages to hold a tight balance between the solid malt bill and copious hops, so it’s clearly well crafted. Nicely done.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/287/17112/,Hopslam Ale,2023,10,28

Cloudy, pale gold colored body. One finger of white head which retreats quickly to a few islands and a ring. Leaves behind thicker webs of lacing.
Aroma of pine resin and orange/grapefruit/pineapple hops.
Taste is juicy and bright. Flavors of orange marmalade, some grapefruit, and pineapple. Good amount of pine resin but the bitterness is balanced with the juicy sweetness.

Translucent, pastel gold. Proffers up two fingers of finely minced froth that’s white as an untouched snowcap. Modest retention gives way to sudsy, webbed lacing.

Bouquet:
A mango, pineapple, peach smoothie rife with tangy Citra and bright, tangerine-sweet Amarillo, woven together with slender strands of earthy Mosaic.

Feel:
Full-bodied and thick with hop oils, the texture is given a much needed third dimension by a boisterous, peach fuzz carbonation.

Taste:
A huge chomp of just-ripe, yellow mango topped with shreds of candied orange peel. Then, lemony Citra and the tropic sweetness of Amarillo rise like flowers from the distinct, new earth flavor of Mosaic hops.

Color is bright and clear golden yellow with a very thin white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma is clean and not noticeably floral. This leads me to believe it is not the OG recipe. The taste is also not floral but pleasantly bitter. My memory of previous Ruinations is a more earthy bitterness with considerably more on the nose. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad I managed to snag three sixers of the new release. It is definitely a double IPA worth the name and I will likely pick up a couple more.

430,ryan1788a5,Massachusetts,4.0,2023-03-14,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. 2017 vintage, 5 years old. 

A: The most vigorous pour I could muster did not turn up any head. Deep brown in color with good clarity. I half expected sediment, but there really isn't any. Not much in the way of lacing either. A few tiny specs.

S: A lot of raw honey, apricot, malty aromas of fig jam and a pop of berry. Highly estery with pineapple/tropical notes. Orange marmalade complete with peels. Earthy and leafy notes with that aged ""forest floor"" character. Treacle and a hint of toast/crust. 

T: Follows the nose. Lots of raw honey up front, figs and berries, richer malty notes of molasses and toasted crust and scones. Very tropical and estery- big notes of pineapple, starfruit, papaya. Orange marmalade. Hit of warming alcohol. Downright spicy with herbal oiliness. Earthy and leafy. Dose of ""musty book"" and nutty sherry oxidation. Aggressive spicy/oily hop finish with trailing alcohol heat and figgy malt. 

M: very thick with a ton of coating residual sugar. It is syrupy in texture. Good pressing sense of weight. Carbonation is fading, but there's still some fine pricking around the tip of the tongue. Gritty hop astringency. 

O: This beer becomes very interesting with age. It might be an acquired taste for those who prefer IPAs fresh, though. It becomes a three way brawl between a brawny malt character, aggressively estery alcohol, and a good dose of oily/spicy hops. Age has deepened that malt into a lot of fruity complexity, brought out more earthy ""forest floor"" hop notes, and a lot of musty and sherry-like oxidation. It's also hot and a bit much when fresh though. Something like 1-3 years of age may be the sweet spot for me I think, but it comes down to preferences.

Brings a caramel apple to mind, and then you get piney notes on the back end to remind you you're drinking an IPA. A little alcoholic, which works here. I wouldn't mind it being more bitter. Perfectly carbonated with a full body. 
It's a strange IPA. A prior reviewer said it reminded them of a barleywine, which does track. Another reviewer said it's not an IPA, and I'm not sure I'm equipped to argue with them. I'm not sure what it is, though, other than Very Good. While I do appreciate a beer that is what it says it is, I can also respect a beer that dares to push limits, especially when it's this good.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/64/9086/,120 Minute IPA,2023,1,17
436,atigerlife,Hawaii,4.18,2023-01-02,"First, this bottle is very old. Not sure how old, but could possibly be around a dozen years old. Still have another bottle. So, with that preface...

Pours a dark copper, like dark apple cider. Opaque. Small brown head that dissipated quickly leaving a collar.

Aroma of malt, dark fruit, mild alcohol, dark sugar, spice and somewhat herbal.

Taste is dark fruit, alcohol [but not overpowering], apples, prunes, caramel, bread, bitter orange, dates and pine.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and cleansing. Nicely smooth in the mouth.

Overall, very interesting. Hides the alcohol well and rather complex flavor notes.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/64/9086/,120 Minute IPA,2023,1,2
437,pulse,Ohio,4.28,2022-12-23,"As per plan, this is the Xmas celebration beer, the last holdout from the Extreme box, bottled on 9/13/19. A little over three years old, it pours a deep coppery color into the tulip with lots of head that fades off rapidly into a partial top cloud and ring. It has a sweet, syrupy, and malty smell. It does taste sweet, more sweet than bitter. The bitterness is slighty, lingering around a slight alcohol taste. I think it's like butterscotch and caramel up front. It's a little fruity, definitely along the barleywine track. Fairly thick, syrupy, easy to drink but warming. Moderately carbonated and somewhat dry. Very interesting.

I would love to do a vertical taste test. The last time I had this was in... 2019! At a tasting event that also served Utopias. It's powerful. I'm really out of the race at this point.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/64/9086/,120 Minute IPA,2022,12,23

Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. Glad to finally try something from this venerable brewery and I'm glad I started with this. Getting an IPA from the Midwest that has substantial bitterness is a joy in this hazy age and this is one solid IPA. The malt is somewhat old fashioned with good biscuit notes, but the hops are classic NW IPA, which is my favorite profile. Lots going on here and quite enjoyable.

Look: It pours out a very nice light orange amber color with very tiny floaties. The two fingers of rocky, beige-colored head slowly dissipated. Looks like a nice Imperial IPA.

Smell: It smells super piney along with a bit of citrus notes. I get orange peel and some pepper. There's also some sweet malt notes and some boozy bubble gum notes. For a beer that is this big, the nose is underwhelming.

Taste: This is a huge Imperial IPA. At 9.4% ABV, it really does not taste nearly as strong as it is. It's dangerously drinkable and it's actually somewhat balanced. Up front, it's malty and sweet for a very short time before the hop bitterness takes over. The finish is very bitter and earthy with huge pine notes and grapefruit peel and it lingers super long. Eventually, orange peel and caramel/crystal notes come forward after the bitter hop resins fade from the front of the palate. After pouring the bottom of the can, the body improved a bit but the taste also became slightly chalkier.

Feel: It's medium plus bodied with a nice chewy, slick, and slightly oily mouthfeel.

Overall: This is definitely a solid Imperial IPA. I can appreciate this beer, but it's not really my personal preference to go seeking this out again. I may have had it many years ago via Beer Trade, but at that time I was just looking to seek out the ""big beers"" that were highly rated and I may not have even had an Imperial IPA before, so it was worth trying again.

L: clear, tawny-colored liquid with perhaps a faint hop haze; cratery, exploded foam sponge upon pour, collapsing quick into a thick, gummy collar... two droopy eyebrows of lace

S: semi-characteristically Stone melange of piney, outdoorsy, juice nectary hops along with a cane-sugar syrupy malty underbelly and moderately strident, tonic ethanol kick... upon further sniffage, an herbal cannabis overtone all day... supreme vibrancy if a bit indistinct in its aroma indentifiers

T: bitter-herbal, pungent hops blasting the palate roof while a jammy, citrusy hop and malt nectar permeates the palate floor with its airy, booze-shocked essences... the aftertaste is leavings of fruit and sugar sweetness with the peppery charge of biting bitterness still attacking the top, even cutting through to the sinuses... it's almost like a Malort and Cointreau-infused strong amber ale

F: resinous, silken, near cordial glory, lithe and luxurious yet punishingly pungent... its glassy, ghostly undercurrent is perhaps (along with its hot sauce fire) its most striking characteristic, as it seems to just float in the ether 

O: for all it's brashness, quintessentially Stone in its relentless (to me, fantastic) bitterness, it sports jagged facets of two-dimensional, static, obscure, muddy expressions...

Pours a clear gold, not much to talk aboot in the foam department. 

Smells extremely hoppy but with a big malty bite. Citrus, some pine, leans into some tropical fruit but not hugely. 

Huge Citrus bitterness and the malty sweetness is almost as huge, call it in balance, I reckon. Alcohol is there in spades but it is not hard to deal with. 
A little bit spicy, earthy, vegetal, short sips are best for me.

1036,dano213,Pennsylvania,3.71,2023-01-04,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $3.50. Canned on 10/4/2022, which makes this one day shy of three months old.

Look: Pours a very nice copper color with a slight haze and a fluffy/rocky beige-colored head.

Smell: Strong, hoppy aromas of citrus (grapefruit), pine, and dank notes. Not much else to say. It smells like it will be a bit boozy and there are a lot of spicy hop characteristics coming through. Overall, the aromas are a bit muted.

Taste: My first impression is that this beer does taste very boozy. Up front there is a nice caramel malt backbone, which pretty quickly is overtaken by a plethora of spicy and dank hops. The finish is very bitter with tons of pine resin and some grapefruit rind and pith. It finishes on the dry side and it leaves a warming sensation in the chest.

Feel: It has a slick, oily kind of mouthfeel that is also a bit chewy. Carbonated appropriately. It's also boozy.

Overall: This is very much a West Coast style Imperial IPA. It uses predominantly old school hop varieties and its expression is very much old school. I probably had this beer many years ago and I doubt that I was able to appreciate it then. Honestly, for me it's enjoyable yet I find it to be a bit boring. It's not my favorite style of beer, but I can definitely appreciate it for what it is. It's well-made and given that it is three months old, it doesn't seem like it has suffered much due to age.

From the can/website:
The Maharaja flaunts his authority over a deranged amount of hops: tangy, vibrant, and intense along with an insane amount of malted barley – fashioning a dark amber hue and exquisite malt essence. Maharaja is derived from the sanskrit words mahat, meaning “great”, and rajan, meaning “king”. Much like its namesake, this Imperial IPA is regal, mighty, and dank. With citrusy hops and caramel toffee malts as his servants, he rules both with a heavy hand. Don't be fooled by unassuming drinkability, this beer is potent. Welcome to his kingdom!

REGAL | MIGHTY | DANK

1156,Whyteboar,Michigan,4.37,2024-01-05,"The first time I was able to try this I was on Mackinaw Island and one of the pubs had it on tap. As the Grand Hotel only had Bells Oberon (this was in late September, it was brewed in March) this was sublime. But that was before I paid attention.
Now I’ve had it fresh and aged and both are great.
The pour is a reddish tinted amber and fresh it has a dense beige head that leaves rings of lacing.
The taste, oh my. Fresh it’s a menagerie of hops that assault your mouth with no intent on letting you surrender. Piney grapefruit, herbs and grass and some flavors I still can’t describe. To top that off, it’s somehow balanced with malty flavors and rein in the bitter and provide a nice base. 
Aged the malty flavors take the lead and the hops not so much fade as morph into edging for the malt flavors so it doesn’t get too sweet. Weird the way that works, but tasty!
The feel is so good for the absolute attack of flavors; medium viscosity carries them all easily and makes this a slow sipper.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1199/17538/,Devil Dancer,2024,1,5

I think the fresh ones have a bit of an oniony flavor. Not that I mind it. As it ages the onion fades, leaving behind all that piney, caramel, tarry beauty. Finish leaves a nice bitterness on the tongue. Lucious Mouth feel. Yum!

1159,woemad,Washington,3.96,2020-04-26,"12oz bottle courtesy of Whyteboar. According to the stamp on the rear label, this was bottled on January 16, 2020. Perhaps not ideal for a normal IPA, but as the same rear label makes clear, this ain't no normal IPA, as it clocks in at a fierce 12% abv!

Poured into a tulip-shaped hybrid glass (don't know what else to call it), this was a dark amber color, taking on a rubyish hue when held up to light. About an inch or so of beige colored foam was present as head, and left a decent amount of lace for such a strong beer.

Nose was of herbal grassy hops, bready malts, plus a little bit of band aid type aroma. As it warms, it gets a bit boozy.

More promising in the flavor department than in the nose. Grapefruity, piney, peppery and bready - this is a big beer that makes a big impact on the taste buds. Quite a bit of alcohol ""heat"" is present. Unsurprisingly, for a triple IPA from the midwest, there's a massive malt backbone, so for the hops to stand out as much as they do, there must have been an ungodly amount used.

Medium to full body, with a coating, resiny, almost syrupy mouthfeel. 

This is a beast! I imagine this is a beer that is very expensive to make, and get why it's not widely distributed at this point. Enjoyed this in the middle of the afternoon on a day with no commitments outside the home, and that's probably for the best! Thank you for getting this to me, Craig!

Appearance: Crystal clear light honey color, with a big and fluffy off white head. Spotty lacing. Pretty beer.
Smell: Fresh orange, bit of pine, slightly herbal and floral. Not a strong smelling beer, but it smells nice.
Taste: Sweet and bitter. Citrus, mainly with a bit of orange. More of a candied orange than fresh, not artificial though. Good dose of pine in there followed by a lasting bitterness. Malt is straight forward, borderline syrupy and throws some white bread flavor into the mix. Alcohol comes through loud and clear in the taste. Boozy finish.

L: slightly-hazy medium amber-colored liquid; not a huge head on the pour, but it's tight with a frayed cotton contour... only holds a thin collar, thin misty cap; does leave a big band of lace oppo of sip spot

S: very floral initial pop (rosewater), followed by some fleshy orange pulp, lemon/grapefruit zest, background hint of pine... a little honeyish malt wants to poke through... gummy orange slices... only a soft essence of alcohol... excellent overall intensity

T: citrus kiss, but a rush of florality right behind it... the aftertaste is spicy, with a green bitterness that slowly swells... certainly a big malty base, with a muffin/cakey quality, but it's sodden with hop resins... vague dried pale-colored fruit (apricot, sultana) slowly creeps into the aftertaste, while the residual bitterness grows some peppery hair to it... the volume on the bitterness just keeps increasing, speakers cracking and shaking; hop artifacts emerge

F: its bitter bite takes hold on the tongue, mildly intensified by the ethanol, which sets and singes (and yet cools?!) a touch near the back of the palate... its body and resins make for a silky lusciousness up front, giving way to a growing heat; soft carbonation

O: why did this take so long to be released out east here(?), especially considering Furious had been here for years now; this was the first Surly beer I ever heard of c. 2011 (though Darkness and Bender weren't far behind)...

Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy (80% clarity) medium orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 9. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of rich grapefruit, tropical mango and melon. Resinous, earthy, and tropical. Some tropical peach evolves as it warms. (4.25) 

Flavor: Flavors follow the nose with strong tropical grapefruit, pineaple, mango/melon with a sweet peach undertone. A moderate balance of sweet and smooth caramel balanced by bitter pine notes. (4.25)

Feel: Heavier bodied, strong carbonation and finishes sweet, but surprisingly clean and drinkable on the palate. (4.25) 

Compared to Revolution Anti-Hero IPA 12/2022: Pours lighter, stronger aromas. More juicy grapefruit, tropical pineapple, melon, and peaches. Less resinous nectarine and syrup. Juicier, but also more balanced with pine bitterness. Winner: Surly

Compared to Surly Axe Man 2/2023: Pours darker, hazier. Stronger aromas. More sweet and juicy tangerine and peach. Less dank berry and pine notes. 
11/2023: Pours darker, more rich and tropical flavors. More dank and bitter. Heavier, but more flavor overall. 

Compared to Great Lakes Ancient Arctic 12/2023: Pours hazier, milder head. Stronger aromas. More dank grapefruit, orange, pine, melon. Less sweet overripe grapefruit, orange, and fruit punch. More bitterness and flavor. 

Overall: Wow a surprisingly fantastic IPA here. Grapefruit, tropical pineapple, mango/melon, and peach flavors. Juicy with enough pine and grapefruit citrus rind to balance. Beldns NEIPA juicy flavors with west-coast body and mouthfeel. Sort of reminds me of Half Acres IPA blends and not unlike Axe Man in many ways. I hate imperial IPAs as the alcohol and sweet malts ruin the hop flavors and IPA bitterness nearly every time. This one may be the exception. It's has big juicy orange and tropical melon/berry flavors with a resinous pine bitterness off the end. Sweet, but nicely balanced by bitterness. An imperial WCIPA that packs enough bitterness.

Very mild cereal grain flavor carrying a zesty, spicy hop flavor; white pepper, sage and turmeric; moderate bitterness; very quiet alcohol presence. Medium-heavy mouthfeel; smooth and lightly velvety; bold alcohol warmth presence; semi-dry at the finish.

I know I've had this beer before, likely before my BeerAdvocate days. Regardless, this is my first rating and review of this beer. It is a solid, easy drinking imperial India pale ale. Simple yet alluring.

Tastes Big. A punch in the mouth of well balanced maltiness and stanky piney hops. Resiny. Crisp finish featuring a bitter hop note.

Smells like pot. I cant smoke it but I sure like the smell and beer taste of it.

Tastes super dank. Super weedy. Sweet and caramely with a sticky, sticky resinous piney darkness. Old school as fuck and super big on malt and hops.

Feel is OILY and gelatinous. Finishes very crisp though. Intriguing beer.

Overall - I've definitely had this before but I always seems to ignore great divide for whatever reason. I think im primarily annoyed by their yeti series and how they absolutely try to milk the fuck out off it, but thats another topic. Regardless, its been a LONG time since I've bought a GD beer (probably close to ten years) but this beer is a super nice reminder of where beer was at 10-15 years ago.

1514,Darkmagus82,Texas,4.41,2024-01-30,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a hazy orange-amber color with a puffy head of white foam. The head has a great level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving lots of spiderweb lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – the aroma is quite heavy of a tropical fruit smell of papaya, passionfruit, and pineapple mixed with lots of tangerine and some aromas of honeydew and grape. Along with these smells comes notes of a light graininess and some hop smells of pine and grapefruit. A touch of earthiness and some hay round it all out, producing a quite inviting smell.
Taste – The taste begins with a bready and slightly more thick malt flavor paired with some of the tropical fruits of papaya and pineapple that were in the nose. There is also a decent showing of tangerine and orange as well as some very light lemon. The hops are present right from the start with flavors of herb and pine being the strongest, but being accompanied by a bit of grapefruit as well. As the taste advances the sweetness gets a touch stronger as a light peach and apricot taste join in. The alcohol is well hidden, but can be tasted at the end, and with some a decent earthiness, one is left with a rather robustly hopped taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is slightly more thick and chewy with a carbonation level that is lower than normal. For the style and the tastes, the feel is awesome, really allow you to sense all the rich flavors and appreciate the higher abv with a sipping brew.
Overall – A quite nice double with lots of flavor and bigness. Would recommend this one.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/26/52531/,Arctic Panzer Wolf,2024,1,30
1515,ThisWangsChung,Maryland,3.81,2024-01-11,"Pours a slightly murky copper color with about a finger's worth of head, eggshell colored and pretty rough in texture. The aroma is classic Three Floyds IPA - honeydew melon, grapefruit, mango, lemon, and passionfruit pop assertively. There isn't much malt backbone apart from a hint of caramel. There's just something so comforting about an older school, non-hazy IPA bringing this much tropical fruit aroma. The taste, thankfully, follows the nose pretty well, though the malt presence shows up a bit more boldly on the palate. Still, a huge wave of mango, lemon, grapefruit, and melon hit the palate running. Remember how I talked about the more assertive maltiness? The finish features a decent amount of caramel and toffee, as well as a touches of booze and sugar. The boozy presence is the only thing preventing me from giving the taste a 4, but it's still a good DIPA regardless. The feel is crisp and a little fuzzy, with a long finish. I don't expect creaminess from an assertive DIPA like this, though. The sugar presence is a bit more prevalent than I'd like, slowing drinkability down slightly. Carbonation is medium. Overall, I'd put this a little above Dreadnaught and a little below Permanent Funeral.

1519,teromous,Virginia,3.47,2023-02-04,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKGD ON 11/18/22 Q0711""
This was a 16oz can from a 4-pack.

Appearance: The body is nearly opaque which allows only a very faint haze of a blurry shadow through. It has a deep golden amber body which is on the darker side but not quite bronze. There is a short and fluffy white head which maintains a thin layer of fluffy film over the surface with a creamy and fluffy ring around the glass. There is some spotty lacing.

Aroma: At first some wildflower aroma came through, then some fruity peach and grapefruit came to the nose. There is a touch of cabbage but each time it becomes apparent, it pops out and is replaced by a more fruity aroma.

Taste: The flavor closely mimics the aroma here. There is this somewhat floral opening to the beer giving it a wildflower note up front which is a bit soap-like. Then it develops more citrus character on the tongue; largely this mixture of pithy grapefruit and blood orange. These two citrus notes persist to the end. It has a somewhat grassy finish. After a while some candied orange also comes through a tad.

Mouthfeel: Bitterness on this beer is high. It has a body that is on the lower edge of medium with a touch of slickness. It is a bit of a slow drinker given the high bitterness and the somewhat medium body.

Overall: The citrus notes in this beer and the strong bitterness are the highlights. There is plenty to enjoy when it comes to both of these qualities. The beer also has a floral note which is not bad but when combined with the grassy character it clashes with the more citrus-centric notes of the beer. It's an alright beer but I'm not likely to buy it again over what is readily available on the market. The beer I purchased was consumed within 3 months of being canned so I might try it again if it was on tap or if it was fresher than the one I purchased. I wouldn't advocate for or against it, but I would recommend a single can or a sampler before buying a 4-pack.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/26/52531/,Arctic Panzer Wolf,2023,2,4

1576,flagmantho,Washington,4.15,2024-02-24,"I had this beer on-tap in a tulip glass at Special Brews in Lynnwood, WA. 

Appearance: medium-light golden hue with just the tiniest wisp of haze and practically no head.

Smell: a light, sweet, almost tropical fruitiness with some piney hop character atop a pretty pronounced malt aroma. Nice.

Taste: richly malty and a bit sweet, but with lots of bitterness backing it up. There’s a little fruity character here, I’m thinking from fermentation, along with some piney/grassy notes from the hops. It’s interesting — a rich flavorful beer, but neither as cloying nor as harsh as TIPAs often are. Worth the hype? Maybe. But certainly a good beer.

Mouthfeel: medium body with a good level of carbonation and creaminess.

Overall: I like this beer a lot, and I bet if I’d tried it 15 years ago it would have blown my mind (and my palate). In today’s IPA climate, competition is tough and we as consumers are spoiled.

1633,Radome,Florida,3.92,2023-04-15,"Tasted from a 16 oz can bought in Ohio.

L - Light copper color makes it look more like an amber ale than IPA. Perfect clarity. Cream colored head faded quickly after the pour, leaving just a thick ring around the glass.

S - Sweet candy-like hops aroma has citrus, avocado and wood-like notes, with tropical fruit at a lower level. There is also a cardboard note in the finish that seems to have been caused by oxidation or age.

T - Strong hops flavors, again with citrus and tropical fruit, but also an herbal note. There is also a malt presence, with sweet bread, reminding me of Hawaiian dinner rolls, and very light caramel. The oxidized note in the nose does not seem to emerge in the flavor, luckily. the malt/hops balance is fairly even, as expected for a DIPA.

F - Medium to thick body, with some mouth-coating sweetness. Bracing hops bitterness helps cut through the sweetness. Medium carbonation is prickly rather than creamy. Strong, slightly hot alcohol presence.

O - This is a tasty DIPA, but the aroma has an apparent age or oxidation-related flaw. The bottom of the can has the date 4/18/23, which can't be the ""born-on"" date, because I am drinking it before that date. Perhaps it is the ""best before"" date and I was getting close to that, which could explain why it doesn't smell like the freshest sample.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/73/90156/,Chillwave,2023,4,15

Aromas of malt, pine and lemon.

A very good Imperial IPA. Definitely malt forward with tastes of piney resins, lemon and pineapple. Rather bitter aftertaste. The ABV is pretty noticeable but doesn’t overwhelm the overall taste.

Thicker consistency with low carbonation.

Overall, a great tasting IPA. You have to enjoy the bitterness of this type of IPA to appreciate this brew but it’s right up my alley. I’d seek out in the future…cheers!",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/73/90156/,Chillwave,2022,5,15

Notes via stream of consciousness: So what makes Chillwave, Chillwave? I know it's an Imperial IPA at 9% with 80 IBUs but there are no hops listed on the label, nor any malts. It's a hazy deep copper in color beneath a short head of khaki colored foam so there must be some specialty malts in it. Ahhh, let's just taste it and see. Firstly it's got an interesting malt aroma to it. It's almost like oatmeal raisin cookies crossed with banana bread and then some added citrus and pine notes are thrown in. The taste follows with the malt acting as a solid support for the hops. I get orange, pineapple, pine, a little bit of grapefruit, apple, sweet bread, English biscuits, a light drizzle of golden caramel, some honey, and a swirl of spiciness that's most likely due to a combination of the alcohol and hops. That's impressive! It's not as bitter as you'd think given the listed 80 IBUs because there's actually a lot of malt there as well. It's sweetish and malty overall, and it finishes semi-dry with a dollop of honey-ish malt and some herbal and gently piney character lingering. In the mouth it's medium-full in body and gently crisp-then-smooth. The head held up fairly well but it didn't leave a whole lot in the way of lacing. With everything said and done this is a great double IPA with an interesting and compelling malt component that's threaded through with a pleasant array of hop flavors.

1691,JohnniEMc,Pennsylvania,4.52,2024-02-11,"Easy answer here: What should be better than a Simcoe hopped IPA? A Double Simcoe, of course. The entire contents of a pint can have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. It was a beautiful pour, with just the right sized and composed off-white head. Although it was short-lived, it was once lovely. What remains intact is the full and bright copper-amber color of the liquid. It's hazy to the point of opaqueness. There's a nice balance to its aroma between malt and hops, although it doesn't have quite the bite of some Simcoe hopped IPAs. This serving just came out of the refrigerator, so that likely makes an impact. Even chilled, the hops fulfill their expectations and make this a wonderfully bitter hopfest. They come through with piney, resinous and earthy features, in a body that carries them superbly. The relatively high ABV only augments the overall taste and the clean bite at the finish. The scant glass lacing is also effected by that. If oats and/or wheat have any part in this, it's so minimal that it makes no difference. This is a solid West Coast style IPA, although some may find it a little too malty. Most should consider this an outstanding representative of the style.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/392/30288/,Double Simcoe IPA,2024,2,11

Its smell features ripe red berry, apricot, and pine sap. The taste largely follows with a strong malty base, with sticky, ripe berry, subtle tropical notes, pine resin, and sharp, biting bitterness throughout. There is just a hint of hop burn at the finish. The mouth feel is plush and creamy with a pleasant level of carbonation, and it drinks big for its 9% ABV. Overall, the idea of a single hop Simcoe DIPA is great and Weyerbacher has pulled if off very nicely.

Taste is extremely dry, this is really only for someone who enjoys the tongue-melting high-powered IPA flavors that a lot of modern beers are moving away from. It's less of a dank or juicy flavor but an overwhelming amount of hops. You can definitely taste the 10.5% and it's not shy about reminding you that it's an experience. In spite of all of this, it's insanely refreshing. I hate to say it, but my palate would be very happy using this as a session beer. Unfortunately, my liver wouldn't make it past the second, but the beautiful combination of strong malt to help balance out outrageously aggressive hops means that while it comes off as very heavy, it's horribly easy to drink.

Mouthfeel is perfect. My first 4pk was flat and really grossly boozy, but the beer itself is lightly carbonated. Doesn't coat the mouth or dry you out whatsoever. Additionally, since it's so dry, there's no residual sugar and it's quite refreshing like an IPA should be.

Overall, 3 Floyds had no reason to help me out and replaced my beer after a weird mishap rendered my original 4pk completely disgusting. I have no idea what happened but they got back to me and replaced it within a day.

The actual product is outrageously delicious and lives up to all the hype I had after seeing the can art and that it was a collab with a metal band. You could probably drink 3 of these in an hour, and then have a really bad morning. It's really that good.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/26/91670/,Permanent Funeral,2023,11,16

Partly cloudy, deep gold colored body. One finger of soapy, white head. Leaves behind rings of lacing.
Aroma is floral, tropical, and pine.
Taste is heavy with hops, with flavors of grapefruit, melon, pineapple, and a little onion. Slightly bitter pine sits in the background. Sweet citrus lasts into the aftertaste.
Nectar-like mouth feel. Residual tongue burn. Very good carbonation.

1994,Hooded,Texas,3.91,2022-11-10,"12oz can poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
Appearance is golden-orange with 2 fingers of white head. Retention is average leaving a lot of light lacing and a cap.
Smell is medium in strength. It smells like orange, mango, grapefruit, pineapple, pine and malt.
Taste is somewhat below medium-high in strength. The taste starts with an herbal flavor followed by hints of mango and maybe passionfruit that's quickly overtaken by a sweet malt base. The malt base becomes drier with a pine hop bitter finish that's not quite medium-high.
Feel is a bit below medium-high in thickness. It's fairly chewy with low carbonation and low astringency.
Overall, it's a very good beer that hides the high ABV well. It's fairly easy to drink. It does a lot of things very well and there's nothing about it that's truly outstanding.

1999,Jethro1331,Texas,1.66,2021-07-24,"I look to Beeradvocate to give a reasonably accurate take on the quality. On this one, I have no idea where the 95 is coming from. I have bought one other hazy from Odell and it was average. After I saw the 95 on this one, got excited, bought it and was disappointed.

I'm not that worried about the look but nothing to look at, seems strangely darker than a bright hazy.
Smell - it's not that pleasant - it's like it's trying to be floral but failing with some detergent overtones
Taste - astringent and sour. I don't think it's because of the high alcohol content. Just don't think it was ever balanced right and maybe they attempted to compensate with extra alcohol or something. Regardless, the taste is really off-putting.
Feel - definitely not fluffy or something you'd feel on a good NE / hazy IPA.
Overall - not enjoyable. We usually by 4-6 different IPAs at a time, this was our least favorite and really don't want to finish it.

Another reviewer called out that it tastes like barely wine - agree. It's like they attempted to package something else as a high-octane NE / hazy IPA and it's a fail.

L: 4.75, S: 5, T: 5, F: 4.75, O: 5
Even with the advent of the NEIPA, which I love, I still think this is one of the better crafted IPAs in New England.

Review canned: 08/23/22

L: Gandhi Bot pours a deep gold to pale amber color with a medium plus haze. A slightly aggressive pour yields a pillowy two fingers off-white head which slowly falls to a 4 mm ring that is retained as the beer recedes in the glass leaving a beautiful mass of webbed and ringed lacing. 

S: On the nose I get a lot of oranges, light notes of citrus pith, caramel and grainy malt character, prominent marijuana notes, and light notes of earthy pine resin.

T: The palate follows the nose pretty closely presenting waves of orange and grapefruit flesh on the front end supported by a nice grainy and caramel malt backbone that comes in mid palate where it mixes with big herbal notes of marijuana and bitter citrus rind. On the backend and finish the citrus rind continues mixing with notes of earthy pine resin lending an impressive amount of bitterness (think IBU wars level). There is also a barely perceptible hint of ethanol in the background, but that quickly fades after the first few drinks.

F: This one has a medium body with lively medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is crisp with a nice dry finish.

O: When I first moved to Connecticut in 2010 Gandhi was fairly new and was all the rage with lines forming anytime it was released as this was pre canning and also before you could drink anything other than samples in the taproom. I remember going to pick up some growlers of this a few days before Thanksgiving 2011 and the line was all the way to the street (luckily I was near the front of the line). Needless to say this is one of those beers where the hype train is real. Gandhi has both big malt and hop flavors which are perfectly balanced and complementary. The only real negative for this beer is that compared to the rest of NEBCO's regular roster it's shelf stability is not as rock solid and starts to fade (at least for me) around the 1.5 month mark. Either way, this is in my mind the quintessential DIPA and is up there with the likes of Heady Topper. Highly recommended!",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/357/57259/,G-Bot,2022,8,27
2057,metter98,New York,4.19,2022-06-23,"A: The beer is slightly hazy amber yellow in color. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that left a thin layer of bubbles covering most of the surface, a thin collar around the edge and lots of lacing down the sides of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of orange citrus are present in the nose along with notes of candy.
T: The taste follows the smell and also has additional notes of papaya with hints of pine towards the finish. There is a light to moderate amount of bitterness and some hints of alcohol in the taste.
M: It feels medium-bodied and quite crisp on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer definitely tastes like an Imperial IPA as you get some alcohol in the taste but it has a nice mix of flavors.

A: Slightly hazy light amber with 2-finger foamy light beige head with good retention and solid lacing. 

S: Tons of pine resin, peach, grapefruit, lime, and grassy hop notes. Clean, no esters. Subtle background light caramel malt note. 

T: in the flavor, there's a solid pale malt backbone with light caramel nuances. The happiness is strong with pine, grapefruit, peach, and a very resinous grassy finish. Bitterness is medium-high. There's no yeast character or esters. Aftertaste is bitter and resinous. Alcohol is well hidden throughout.

M: this beer is dangerously lean with medium body, moderate carbonation, and a very dry finish. I think I drank this entire beer in about 5 or 6 sips.

O: this is a highly drinkable old-school double IPA with a very dry finish. This is an excellent example of the American double IPA style.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/357/57259/,G-Bot,2022,1,24

Nose of a convoluted battle between hop, malt, pine, caramel and ?!? teriyaki ?!?

Palate of hops and hops interlocked in a battle with malts, caramels and pine. Semi thick mouth feel with slight sting left on the tongue. Higher AVB not really noticeable on the mouth but definitely warms the central nervous system after several quaffs.

This one aged rather well becoming smoother. Just the teriyaki aroma on the nose I can't place my finger on and seemed a little off.

O: Stumbled into this one at a Total Wine while out of town for the weekend. No date code to be found on the can, but according to the shelf tag it arrived fairly recently so I snagged it.

Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden color with a small head of white foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading over time and leaving a bit good showing of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma I quite heavy of a tropical fruit smell of tangerine, mango, and pineapple. Along with these aromas comes notes of apple and pear as well as a bit of apricot. Hop aromas of grapefruit abound, being joined by a bit of pine and herb. Along with these smells comes notes of a caramel and toffee smell as well as a touch of grain.
Taste – The taste begins with a crisp cracker malt and lightly grainy flavor with tons of tropical fruit flavors of tangerine and papaya. Other flavors of peach, apricot, and caramel are there as well, enhancing the sweetness a bit. AT the same time there are hop flavors of grapefruit and pine, as well as notes of a floral hop. THE former hop flavor is the most intense, with it gaining in strength as the taste advances. At the same time there is a slight decrease in the sweet, all while there is a subsequent increase in the grain and pine. The mix of flavors that develops as the taste advances is met with a bit of mustiness at the very end, leaving one with a crisp, fruity, and decently hopped taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a more middle of the road carbonation as well. For the abv, fruity flavors, and crisp nature the feel is good and makes for an easy sipper.
Overall – A rather nice double overall. Flavorful and quite drinkable. A solid brew.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/28178/77708/,Ninja Vs. Unicorn,2023,7,11

Aroma is absolutely killer - tropical fruit - pineapple, ripe orange, orange peel, piney and a bit sweaty. Just a little bit herbal with a whiff of green onion.
Sweet upfront with the pineapple, ripe orange, and tangerine but with a decent blast of piney and resinous hops and an herbal bitterness at back - perfect balance of fruity sweetness and pungent bitterness.
Medium full mouthfeel with bright carbonation - goes down with a sticky bittersweetness that lingers nicely.
Fantastic.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/20681/115317/,Dinner,2023,10,7

A mildly hazy light orange with a dense, white head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is gloriously hoppy, pungent, fruity, pine, dank, melon, grape, orange, mandarin. A true riot of hops. The palate opens clean, fruity, bitter, pungent and oily. Grapefruit, mandarin, citrus zest, melon, grape, mild peach. There's a softness to the palate that really accentuates the hops. A light sweetness. Soft, creamy finish with lingering hop oils.

2419,Smakawhat,Maryland,4.51,2023-07-26,"Poured on tap a snifter at Churchkey DC.

Beaming pale gold, with hints of orange color, and some fine carbonation. Soft creamy top of finger presented, with an off white appearance and bowled tilted lacing.

Aroma is a wonderful spiced orange. Juiced Christmas mandarin nose, with hints of spice and leafy green sensing hops. Soft bodied and creamy vanilla sensing malt to match make an impressive hop nose.

Palate is richly good, but no surprises. Creamy sensing body along with the flavors, if anything its mouthfeel is the most impressive. Mid palate rich in peeled and juiced orange tangerine notes. Finish accentuates soft green herbs, to an almost minty finish but a more pungent flavor, and sharper astringency like a soft pine. Still manages great balance keeping soft vanilla like flavored sweetness, and that classic Creamsicle orange like flavor.

It's not that exotic or dynamic, just a solid ipa done with exceptional base flavors. Very nice!",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/20681/115317/,Dinner,2023,7,26

2468,JohnniEMc,Pennsylvania,4.06,2023-08-23,"Well, initially, it's monster foam, anyway. There's difficulty getting the contents of a pint can to empty entirely into a clear glass liter mug. Thus, the modern IPA, but this is notably excessively foamy. Whatever happened to a decent ale head? This starchy white mess recedes unevenly, with irregular glass lacing. Beneath the foam lays a pretty bright colored copper-amber, that is moderately translucent. The aroma is almost all earthy hops, earthy starches and alcohol. Maybe alcohol most of all. The taste begins with a malty sweetness that's better than expected. The body is relatively rich and smooth, both to a degree that's better than expected. Either expectations were ridiculously low, or this performs way above the reasonable ones. The taste begins with a sweet malt backing that is rich and smooth enough to carry its foundation throughout the drinking experience. Just as the great ones do, this IIPA has the transition from earthy and nearly sweet to hoppy bitter, in a resinous, yet dry way. No doubt, the ABV contributes to the dry bite at the finish. An interesting category, highly potent craft beers and this is one of the good ones.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/73/18421/,Lake Erie Monster,2023,8,23

16 fl. oz. can coded ""30686BM 03/21/22""
$3.99 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: How strong is this monster? 9.5% - that's respectable. 80 IBUs! The label also lists ""torrid tropical fruit flavors"". I've had this beer before but it was years ago. Somehow I don't think it was very tropical back then. It's poured a hazy amber colored body beneath a full head of rocky off-white foam. The aroma is malty, bready, lightly caramelish, piney, spicy, resinous, and delicately citrusy. On to the taste... well the ""torrid tropical fruit flavors"" aren't exactly there but there is some character to it. The sweetish malt remains, and it's both a bit caramelish and a touch honeyish. The pine, spice, resin, and delicate citrus remain as well. I'm going to call it mainly orange. Other flavor notes include non-specific melon and dull papaya. The alcohol is clear but as I've said before I expect a bit of it in such a large beer. I wonder if it's creating that spiciness or just adding to it. Regardless, the spiciness and the alcohol help the bitterness to tame the sweet malt and eventually dry it in the finish leaving a dollop of honeyish papaya and orange to gently fade. In the mouth it's medium-full in body and gently crisp with a fine-bubbled carbonation. The head held up fairly well and I still have an almost complete surface covering more than halfway through the glass. The lacing was decent as well but not great. It's hard to say because I haven't had one of these in so long BUT I'm pretty sure that it's improved. It's quite enjoyable, and at a good price.

(7/22/21) I would guess my can was old because the taste was mostly bitter, and not very fruity or complex at all. I probably would not buy again, judging from this can, but I would like to find a fresher version so I will keep looking.

Beamin juicy orange colored body, with a touch of haze and light visible carbonation. Three finger forming head, a bit of soapy and big bubbled appearance which pops easily, with light retention. Still manages to stick around and leave a tall collar as well, making a nice crowned appearance.

Delicious aroma. Hop pressing front nose with light citrus, and faint touching juicy tropical notes. A nice creamy touch almost sweet vanilla, mixing with a light caramel and crispy malt quality. Comes off like hinting of light powdered sugar on fruity pancakes quality.

The mouthfeel on this is just unreal. An intense solid backbone that is creamy with just a light touch of pushing sweet tones on the palate. The mid hits with thick THICK controlled orange and pine notes, mixing sweet cream and orange, and pine/earth heat. Bitterness comes in the finish, so ever slowly, with first notes of tangerine and Christmas spices, then with lingering notes of pepper and wood bitterness.

T: Grapefruit and sweet malt dominates the beginning, the hops come into play by this point and play very nicely with the grapefruit. These dank, citusy notes do not overpower and keep the beer tasting fresh. It finishes clean, especially for a DIPA.

Instead, there's a modest just-off-white head that might be enduring. Maybe there's actually some barley malt in an IPA. Imagine that! Its color is amber, with a slightly golden tint.The aroma has a nice hop/malt balance, although nothing is pronounced. This is a nicely balanced tasting Double IPA. It's not overly hoppy, nor is it overly malty. It doesn't bring a major hit on either side. Another thing that doesn't hit is the 8.2% ABV, which seems to only bitter the hop bite a bit and dry out the finish. Now that it seems to be West Coast versus New England styles, put this in the West Coast category. It's hoppy, but not too bitter, but there's no softening starches like wheat and/or oats to muddle what an IPA is traditionally supposed to be. OK, The glass lacing isn't extraordinary; but, it's acceptable, like everything else is, at least, for its style. It's the same with the overall. There's nothing outstanding about this, perhaps excepting the taste and mouthfeel in relation to its ABV. But, there's also nothing even closely wrong about it, neither.

2895,JohnniEMc,Pennsylvania,4.08,2023-03-16,"Well carbonated, no, make that overly carbonated, this almost explodes out of the cracked open pint can. Then, the big stark white foam on top prevents a clean one-try pour into a clear glass liter mug. The foam consumes more than half the inside of the vessel, not a good sign. Typical of the modern ""IPA"", the likely barley malt deprived foam recedes unevenly and unattractively, leaving irregular glass lacing. Beneath that mess lies a beautiful copper-amber liquid that's hazy, but bright. The aroma is all hops, bringing both citrus and pine notes. There's plenty of simple sweetness to be had within the taste. Were it a little more complex, this could be an excellent beer. Maybe it's not excellent, but it's very good. The combination of citrus-like and piney hopping follows through from the nose to the tongue. For a brew that doesn't rely solely on barley malt for its backbone, this is smooth, very smooth for its ABV. Only in the aftertaste is the alcohol noticed at all and it doesn't detract much. A little more complexity within the body would make this a great one. But, that's not there, so it's only very good.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/19544/52928/,Hop JuJu,2023,3,16

2898,MacMalt,New Jersey,4.43,2022-05-01,"Canned on 2/9/2022. Poured into a snulip glass. It pours a hazy, bright orange color with almost two fingers of foamy, egg white head and thick, soapy lacing. The smell is a fragrant blend of pineapple, tangerine, lemon, grapefruit, bready malt, and floral hops. Despite its age the fruit hasn't faded. There's abundant orange/tangerine and tart lemon, lime, and grapefruit rind. The Ekuanot hops are used well. Beneath the fruit is a solid base of Carapils malt that adds sweetness and balances the bitterness of the hops. The Simcoe contributes earthy, resinous pine notes while the Mosaic adds additional spiciness throughout. My guess is that when fresher there is more tropical fruit and berry flavors, as well. Still, it's very well-balanced and flavorful. The mouth feel is moderately thick and creamy with pleasant carbonation, and it drinks very easily for 9% ABV. Overall, I understand why so many beer nerds rave about Hop Juju. Even at almost 3 months it's a terrific DIPA.

Turns out, lo and behold—this brew actually tastes exactly like Lagunitas’ Super Cluster, except even better and even stronger!! How did I get so blessed to find such a find?! Pours a beautiful golden, deep honey color…smell follows the nose…LOADS of delicious citra hits your nose and that exactly what you taste….not sure if I’m actually smelling/tasting the simcoe as well, as the delicious citra hops steal the show for me. Mouthfeel is so yummy and chewy…and the ABV is perfectly blended into the flavor and mouthfeel…seriously, in my opinion—the best IPA I’ve ever tasted! Mind you—it IS on the very pricey side at like $9.99 for ONE 1 pint 3.2oz tall can…but it’s such a treat to drink, and the ABV in this will have you feeling so nice! I’d say I’d only still prefer Lagunitas’ Super Cluster only because I can get a 6-pack cans for around the same price as one can of this…but I’ve been having a hard time finding fresh Super Cluster, so this is my new go-to for citra hop heaven!

3078,jrc1093,Connecticut,4.35,2019-05-01,"2017 vintage; on-tap at The Malted Barley, Westerly, RI

Pours a gorgeous, clear, deep golden orange-amber capped with a persistent head of off-white foam; a heavy smattering of thick, soapy lacing coats the glass while a dense collar of foam cling holds tightly through the final sip.

Aroma shows an eclectic combo of prominent vanilla and bourbon welcoming herbal hops and citrus peel almost effortlessly into the fold, well-integrated hints of smoky barrel and tinges of caramel and flambeed orange for further depth and contrast; potency and detail keeps pulling me back for more nosing.

Taste shows the bourbon and vanilla toning themselves down just a bit, allowing more caramel, grapefruit, dank candied orange, oaky barrel, and honeycomb through at varying intensities; impressive mixture of hoppy citrus and sweet barrel tones continue to meet in the middle for harmonious results in the palate.

Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and moderately carbonated, and capped with an excellent booziness; sticky at first, but dries out quickly and evenly along the palate; faint hoppy bitterness/oaky grit appears on the finish, allowing a subtle boozy/hoppy character to continue developing calmly even after the swallow.

I can't shake the feeling I came across this beer at its apex in both age and serving format (~2 years old and on-tap); I'm thinking it would be much boozier and possibly unhinged fresh out of a bottle. That bit of unwarranted pessimism aside, what I've presently got in front of me is a ridiculous collision of barrel and big-time DIPA, no doubt aided by 2 years aging, but nevertheless resulting in a great warming type of beer; the booze is so well integrated as to be present but unobtrusive; whatever it is (maybe due to the aging), it's resulted in an impressive brew straddling beautifully the fine line between two contrasting profiles.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1199/47659/,Doom,2019,5,1

Although the head is stark white and somewhat foamy, it's not expanding like some aerosol insulation. There's some malt and hops to smell, but they're muted, maybe even cluttered. There's good and bad, or at least not so good about the taste. From the onset, there's a nicely sharp hop bite. But the added lactose, however mildly dosed, makes this a little too sweet, something only rectified during the finish. This is hard to believe it couldn't be better without the milk sugar. Surprisingly, the lactose doesn't add much to the body. Yet, for those that don't want a sticky IPA, that's not a problem. There's more taste of alcohol than there is glass lacing and the head is short-lived.

Juicy aromas of tropical fruit, including mango, papaya, guava and passion fruit amidst a malt base that evokes honey and caramel. And then there is that lactose aroma, projecting its milky sweetness on the nose. 

Loads of juicy and big fruity hops flavors evoking notes of mango, papaya, passion fruit and guava. Very sweet with milky lactose creaminess and sweet alcohol spices. Tempered somewhat by a resiny bitterness as well as grassy and piney flavors. Nevertheless, this doesn’t quite feel like enough to counteract the cloying lactose sweetness. 

Full bodied with a frothy, soft and creamy mouthfeel. The carbonation was moderate to easy going. Too sweet overall with a boozy finish that makes this a bit of a chore to drink.

3139,davisdahlberg6,Tennessee,4.06,2021-07-18,"Enjoyed in a 16oz snifter on 7/28/21, canned on 1/15/2021. 
A: Pours a golden orang color with roughly two fingers of white foam, nice lacing as the foam begins to dissipate. Translucent with some sediment floating at the bottom of the glass, but not completely opaque like some of the haze bombs. 
S: Complex nose with notes of melon and tangerine. Other citrus notes of grapefruit and orange rind are present, but certainly more bitter than juicy and sweet. Definite dank smell along with some pine and resin that are present with the caramel hops. Nose is pleasant but nothing to write home about
T: Bitter hops flare up in the beginning and are a bit overwhelming with little to no support from everything else. Pine and resin are present with some grapefruit and orange, bitterness is fairly well balanced by the malty sweetness, but the malty sweetness is a bit overwhelming making me think this beer is less than fresh. 
F: This IPA is almost chewy and is just very full and a bit too much for my liking. A bit too much carbonation as well. Ultimately its still fairly smooth and the 8.6% abv is well hidden but whether it’s the character of the beer or the fact that it has been in the fridge a little too long it has a feel I dislike. 
Overall: Another good beer from 3 Floyd’s, but I have certainly had better from them. The hop character, is pleasant but the lactose and the heavier malt character combine to throw this beer off balance in my opinion. Glad I was able to try it, and if this was the first beer from 3 Floyd’s that I have had I would probably be all over it, but it’s a pretty average beer from them and wouldn’t go out of my way to have it again unless it was really fresh.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/26/46080/,Apocalypse Cow,2021,7,18

L: Pours a pale to medium amber with a medium chill haze. An aggressive pour yields a nice off-white 2 fingers of head. It has ok retention, but what's left is sticky and leaves nice webs of lacing as the beer recedes in the glass.

S: Citrus rind (grapefruit?), Citrus pulp (orange?), a bit of pine, and prominent caramel malt. 

T: This is a hop bomb all right! I get blood orange on the front end flowing into the mid palate where it mixes with sweet caramel malt and sweet Valencia orange. The caramel malt continues and mixes with waves of pine resin bitterness on the finish. At first blush the sweetness is being balanced very well by the bitter finish, but as the beer warms the sweetness starts to win.

F: Medium-full body with medium-light carbonation. The mouthfeel is creamy and a bit sticky with a dry finish.

O: This beer takes a bat made entirely of hops and smacks you in the face while simultaneously shanking you with a sharp malt shiv....old school to say the least. To me it is actually closer to some of the proto-NEIPAs or what we used to call East-coast IPAs; i.e. a nice strong bitterness, moderately sweet, and a nice dry finish. To me, though, this is a bit sweeter than an East-coast IPA. As the beer warms it becomes a bit more unbalanced as the sweetness starts to become more prominent in both the nose and palate. For me that detracts from the palate more so than the nose and it loses .25 to .5 in the taste column as a result. As it warms it is not as balanced as it's younger sibling. Either way, this is a great IPA and a safe harbor in a ""Locust Reign"" of NEIPAs.

S: Balanced aroma of caramel malts and citrusy hops. Simple and classic. 

T: The taste takes me straight back to my formative years as a craft beer drinker, massaging both hops and malt into a perfectly balanced, thoroughly assertive river of flavor. Grapefruit, pine, caramel, and biscuit are all present in equal measure, with everything wrapping up in a solidly bitter, resinous finish with just enough lingering caramel to keep things smooth. Delicious. 

F: On the full side of medium-bodied with ample, velvety carbonation. Sticky in a good way.

Full frontal of hops with lots of tangerine and tropical highlights. Sticky florals and some hempy herbals. Resinous with pine essence that gives way to a decent amount of caramel malt backing here. Slight sweetness about it. ABV’s are masked incredibly well at 10.1% this is dangerously drinkable. Medium with some modest filling. Creamy with a sticky resinous hop linger and a bit of dryness comes out in the finish. 

A bit more chewy caramel body on it with that intense hoppiness. All in all a solid IIIPA.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2743/92971/,Green Bullet Triple IPA,2017,1,12

3371,Ozzylizard,Pennsylvania,4.48,2020-12-30,"On the Wings of Armageddon from DC Brau. Purchased 11/10/20 for $2.31 (Including tax and discount) for 12 oz can ($ 0.192/oz) from State Line Liquors in Elkton, MD. Reviewed 12/30/20.
Stamped on bottom of can “TAKE OFF 10/20/2020 3371”. On room temperature shelf at store and stored at home at 42 degrees. Served at 54 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 56.3 degrees. 
Appearance – 4.5.
First pour – Straw (SRM 3), clear.
Body – Pale gold (SRM 4), hazy. When held to direct light, same but translucent with slight effervescence noted.
Head – Large (Maximum 5.5 cm, aggressive center pour), ivory, medium density, average retention, diminishing to a six to eight mm crown fed two places by effervescence, and a rocky partial cap. Head retraction leaves torn curtain lacing. 
Lacing – Excellent! Wide irregular band of tiny to small bubbles having alpine stalagmites and Indian subcontinent stalactites. See also above.
Aroma – 4.5 – Citrus mixed with pine with some follow-up resin, no malt, no yeast. Lasts although it weakens.
Flavor – 4.5 – Begins with a bit of resiny wood (!) (not oak), a little malt, no yeast. No alcohol (9.2 % ABV, as marked on container) found in either nose or taste but a slight gastric warming does occur. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends with a medium woody bitterness.
Palate – 4.25 – Medium, almost creamy, soft but lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5 Excellent old school IPA, bitter and flavorful. I could drink a TON of these if they were only available in my area!",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/25327/78517/,On The Wings Of Armageddon,2020,12,30
3372,BBThunderbolt,Kiribati,3.52,2020-11-26,"Thanks to Ozzylizard for this one, from a LIF box during the recent NBS BIF #12. 12oz can (dated 10/20/20) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a clean, clear dark gold color with over an inch of white head that had very good retention and moderate lacing.

Big, bold hops (citrus mostly, but some pine) at the front of the nose, with a touch of malt sweetness at the back end.

Same on the tongue, with a nice bitterness on the finish.

The body was medium-full, smooth, and had a bit of a sticky-sweet finish.

Drinkability was very good, the alcohol was nicely integrated into the beer.

Overall, a nice old-school ImpIPA. Worth trying if you see it.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/25327/78517/,On The Wings Of Armageddon,2020,11,26
3373,dano213,Pennsylvania,4.23,2020-11-25,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a 4-pack for $12.99. Canned on 10/20/20, so this is exactly 5 weeks old.

Look: Has a west coast all-the-way kind of look to it. Beautiful orange bordering on amber color. This is essentially clear, with just a fine suspension of particulate floating in there. Tiny bubbles are rising up in the glass. A nice two finger head on the pour has dissipated to a whispy white foam on the edges of the glass.

Smell: Very pungent initially with oniony notes. Lots of resinous pine and orange rind, dank and peppery notes. Very earthy. Subtle sweetness underneath. As I get into it, I can pick up on other fruit flavors like mango, grapefruit, and cantaloupe. Also getting green bell pepper.

Taste: Mmmm. It's dangerously drinkable at 9.2% ABV, especially considering how hoppy this beer is. Kudos to DC Brau for striking this kind of balance also between hop aroma and flavor and maltiness without producing overpowering bitterness. Up front, this beer exhibits a lot of sweetness - tastes very much like candied orange. Then the sweetness is quickly overtaken by pithy hop bitterness - notes of pine and grapefruit zest. The finish is very dry and welcomed with this kind of beer because the alcohol is so high and it takes a lot of malt to make a beer like this, really works well. While the finish is decidedly bitter, it doesn't linger so long and your palate feels ready to dive right back in for another sip.

Feel: This is a medium bodied with a moderately oily mouthfeel. It's drinks relatively light and crisp given the weight of it.

Overall: It's one of the better west coast double IPAs that I have had. Considering that this is 9.2% ABV and the massive amount of hops and malt that was used to brew this beer, it's extremely well made. It's not my favorite of this style, but I definitely enjoy it. A nice showcase of the Falconer's Flight proprietary hop blend.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/25327/78517/,On The Wings Of Armageddon,2020,11,25

Looks fantastic in the glass. Clear deep golden yellow body. Small bright white head persists in decent form throughout leaving excellent lacing.

Strong hoppy aroma.

On tasting, it's one aggressive beer. Highly bitter with a drying grapefruit hit. However, it's also heavily malty and quite sweet. They both duke it out in the mouth with no clear winner, except for me, who is loving it.

Mouth closing in on full, finish bittersweet followed by a dryness.

The smell was that of a wet basement (which can be misleading when it comes to flavor, mind you). NOW onto taste... Its not terrible, there are definitive caramel notes from the malt present, unusual for an IPA in my experience. it finishes with a strong hops flavor that isn't all to surprising.

L -- Golden orange body with total clarity and a finger of white head produced with moderately aerated pour. Some retention and great lacing
S -- Caramel malts, citrus candy, candied pineapple, brown sugar. Quite sweet and malty
T -- As expected from the aromas, this is a big, malty DIPA that reminds me of some of Lagunitas big hoppy offerings, or Hopslam
F -- Big mouthfeel, medium carb. Fairly soft but quite sweet
O -- Glad to finally get a chance to try this. Not quite a standout in the field anymore, but nothing too offensive

Pours out to a hazy burnt orange, forming a small white head with a brisk pour which quickly recedes. Quite low carbonation. ~1.75-2 carbs or so. Lots of flittering gunk on closer inspection. The nose is definitely centennial, mango pineapple, juicy tropical fruit. The taste is quite nice. There is an upfront maltiness which is chewy and has some lingering sweet which hangs out until the bitterness kicks in a bit later. Some grain husk makes its appearance followed by some tannic astringency and pepper wave in the aftertaste, then finishing dry. The bitterness seems nicely balanced....at first. Quite bitter in the finish. No off flavors or aromas. I can't say that the grapefruit adds anything that the hops already don't.

It’s hoppy, it’s malty, it’s crisp, it’s heavy, it drinks like a session beer but pounds you in the head like the 12% it is, all while being $18 ish a six pack.

3491,Shiredave,New York,3.71,2023-12-08,"Let's get 1 thing straight- this is a Barleywine NOT an IPA double. imperial or otherwise. 
Marketing is the only possible reason to inappropriately use those 3 letters on this beer can. A 19 oz. can for a little over $5 btw which ain't bad. Brewed in Philadelphia PA according to the label which seems odd.... contract or new brewery location? 
Looks good - clear medium amber color, tall, dense head of sticky off-white foam - very little drape or spatter of lace but otherwise a pretty glass and a persistent cap of froth. \Aroma is ok - all the right caramel sweetness and earthy herbal hop notes but soft and way too weak for a barley wine much less a 2X IPA. 
Flavor is also weak but very tasty - rich malt is balanced up front with pine and green grass hop flavors but strangely watered down from what I'd expect in so big a beer. 
Ok so it DRINKS more like a double IPA than a BW and extra style points by hiding the abv so well but it also makes me think - why bother? I don't need that extra 3-4% to enjoy it more. In fact, I may even have 2 of these at 8%. 
Body is just barely full with a rough almost harsh back end bitterness while the finish is smoldering but still not hot or boozy.

The color is a light copper-amber that is rather translucent. Although well carbonated, the modest white head is mostly short lived. The smell is more of earthy malt than sharp hops. There is some glass lacing that probably outperforms the head. The taste is close to a perfect blend of malt and hops, sweetness and bitterness and smooth whilst somewhat earthy. A little more sweet, that is a little more, than bitter and just a little too much alcohol hit keeps this from a perfect 10 (taste and mouthfeel combined).

Aroma: Strong aromas of orange, tangerine with some resinous berry and melon underneath. Some nectarine as well. A resinous sweet malt aroma underneath.

Flavor: Strong flavors of resinous orange, tangerine, clementine, nectarine and stonefruit. Some resinous notes. A sweet body circles back to the sweet orange which lingers on the finish. Resinous, but a surprisingly, relatively dry finish. 

Feel: Heavier-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Leans sweet, but surpassingly drier than expected. A deceptively clean mouthfeel. Hides the alcohol extremely well.

Compared to Stone Ruination 2/2024: Pours lighter and hazier , similar head. Milder aromas. Less bitter and dank pine and grapefruit. More orange, tangerine, melon, and berry. More sweet and smooth and less bitter. 

Overall: Usually not a fan of imperial IPAs. This one could change my mind a bit. The body is near perfect. The flavors won't wow you but are there. Finishes surprisingly dry, and hiding the alcohol completely. Dangerously drinkable. Maybe the flavor could be more robust, but drinks so much better than most imperial IPAs.

Smell would indicate this is a very flavorful beer, with the hops and malts all coming out. The taste is where this one loses points. Almost no hop presence, but it is fairly malty. I understand this is a double IPA, but I would have expected WAY more hops. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth and medium bodied, and the alcohol is there. I don't really care for this one to be honest, but I can see some light-beer drinkers liking this one. Needs more hops.

Lower rim of can stamped “CANNED ON 0?/2?/23”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 45.3 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 54.5 degrees F. 
Appearance – 4.25.
First pour – Pale Straw (SRM 2), clear.
Body – Pale Gold (SRM 4), hazy. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, translucent.
Head: Large (Maximum 4.5 cm, aggressive center pour), ivory, high density, average retention, rapidly retreating, leaving a 1.2 – 2.2 cm jagged crown and a rocky complete layer. As the head contracts, irregular elongated islands remain above the head.
Lacing – Good – remnants of the head following the patterns of the head, but thinner.
Aroma – 4.5 – Grapefruit and generic citrus (tending toward pineapple) backed by caramel malt, no yeast. No ethanol (8.5 % ABV as marked on the label) aroma. 
Flavor – 4.5 – Follows the nose. Begins and ends citrusy and full-bodied, a bit dank and resinous over caramel malt. No yeast or ethanol. Barely noticeable gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends crisp and dry with a little resin.
Palate – 4.25 – Full; dry; lively carbonation.

Beautiful clear caramel gold colour with a good finger plus of just off white foam. Soft and velvety with sprinkled large bubbles, it sticks to the glass as it recedes. 

Nose is a great showcase for citra hops, and that works for me, because citra is a great hop! There's some citrus, some pine, some kind of light honeysuckle and wonderful rich complementary caramel malts underneath. 

Flavour isn't quite as rich as the aroma, but it presents all the goodies. Bitter citrus and pine, some caramel malts, some round fruits... finish is bitter but not overpowering by any means. It's mostly in the pith/citrus side of things, but not the full on acid bomb of like a Monkish, and it's balanced with a little bit of earthy pine and a touch of the sweet malts to balance.

3915,TheBricenator,Oregon,4.23,2022-01-13,"Look: Nearly clear burnt orange with a billowing white head that pillows up and slowly puckers away, leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: Pine, floral notes, lemon, tangelos, a little strawberry, oranges, bready malt, and grapefruit rind
Taste: Pine-led conifer and floral hops kick it off and I get some star jasmine, gardenia, and musky rose in the mix. Citrus fruits filter in and join the fold as the bready malt sweetness peeks in to say hello before conifers regain a powerful hold and along with a great bite, close it out
Mouthfeel: Full, lightly slick, medium-high carbonation, a little alcohol heat, and quite dry on the finish
Overall: This is tasty stuff and one of my favorite beers from these folks. It’s a nice, classic, and well-made old-school WCDIPA with all the conifer/citrus aromas/flavors going on plus nice floral notes and with plenty of malt, a little heat, a bold bite, and dryness – all of which jives with me.

Color is deep gold to orange with lots of fine suspended particulate and about 50% transparency. I like the tiny flecks , it reminds me of Bell's Amber Ale.

Nose is rather weak with some malt, maybe a touch of yeast, and some unidentified fruit note.

Taste comes off rather plain with nary a touch of malt and pronounced astringent bitter pine hops. Not crazy bitter but it just stays on the sides of the tongue and mouth and feels metallic, alcoholic and leads to an astringent finish.

Mouthfeel presents as light medium body to start moving to dry one note bitterness and alcohol notes. Finish is astringent and sticky.

This beer is too restrained in flavor and too amped in strong hops that either promote the alcohol taste or tend to mimic it. I would have preferred some more flavor notes from the hops and a bit more malt to counter the strong alcohol vibe.

Beaming crystal clear bronze body, with a brass dark orange glimmering shine. Reams of fine carbonation plentiful and lengthy, reaching to a foam forming superfine bubbled three to four finger off white head. The head creation is one of the tiniest I have ever seen on an IPA, nearly nitrous looking out of the can. Big classic retention and a cream top complete a near perfect look.

Tea and caramel notes on the nose complete a balanced aroma on first exploration. Soft herbs and a sweet hint of crispy caramel sweetness keep things solid. Not so much hop forward at first but slowly revealst it's self. There's some degree of exotic citrus and a unique sweetness that's hard to pinpoint. It's a very unique and distinct old school hop angle it seems, but very impressive.

Palate seem to be right on. Classic hinting West coast like flavor, sorta? but has a pine action East?. Soft caramel with some pine and citrus action and an aftertaste that is very unique. Creamy flavors in the mid palate with an excellent slow explosive heat of pine and astringency. The aftertaste bitterness really slowly builds and almost goes into a chile like experience of heat.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a hazy deep golden slash orange colored body beneath a finger's width of rocky off-white foam. The aroma is piney and lightly citrusy over a sweetish and grainy malt base. This smells like a West Coast IPA to me because it's got that piney Chinook aroma to it. Was it always a West Coast IPA? On to the taste... well there it is again, that Chinook pine. I always use kid gloves when I brew with Chinook because if you use too much it can ruin the beer, especially if it's bitter. You get that bitter and piney-resinous thing going on and it just kills your palate. This, however, is nicely balanced. You get the pine but it's not overdone, and you also get the sweetish malt and citrusy hop notes. There's grapefruit, a little orange, and some mango and berries as well as a lot of herbs. What herbs? I'm thinking oregano and sage, and a brush of rosemary. There's a lot of floral character as well, and a note of apple to boot but there's almost always a note of apple in most beers, even in Budweiser. A firm bitterness anchors it and leads it to a dry and bitter conclusion despite the sweetness of the malt upfront. In the mouth it's medium bodied on the fuller side, and crisp with a fine-bubbled carbonation. The head held up OK, but not great, and the lacing was very good but not excellent. In my mind this is a very good example of the West Coast IPA style but perhaps a bit strong at 8% ABV.

4036,JohnniEMc,Pennsylvania,4.49,2022-08-14,"Research indicates this likely isn't exactly the Galactica IPA, nor the Galactica Imperial IPA, as they have different labels than this pint can. There's good and bad about emptying that can into a clear glass Imperial pint mug. The good is the bright copper-amber color and a head slightly tinted toward that color. The bad was the foaminess of what was a gentle pour, albeit at room temperature. Despite the bright, almost bold color, the brew is close to being translucent. Eventually, the head reduces to a modest level and it sustains. The aroma is a solid one, bringing both malt and piney hops. The taste is maltier than many West Coast styled IPAs. With the growing trend to reduce barley malt from IPAs, this is a welcome characteristic. What it also produces is a body that's vastly smoother and richer than most WCIPAs. Fear not, the malt doesn't make this taste any sweeter than the good ones in this category, which is regarded for the sharp hoppy bite it often provides. If it adds anything to the predominantly piney and resinous hop hit, it adds a layer of earthiness. Some may not like the richer and smoother body, as most West Coast IPAs, even the very good ones, flow a little thinner and lighter. But this is a great example of a Double/Imperial IPA, regardless of the category. The glass lacing is negligible and some of the alcohol makes it into the taste. To date, there is no West Coast IPA category here, so this gets rated as an IPA with a fairly high ABV. The rating is deservedly high, too.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22951/92472/,Galactica,2022,8,14

4094,JohnniEMc,Pennsylvania,3.52,2022-10-21,"There have been disappointing pours attempting to empty a pint can into a clear glass liter mug, but this is memorable as among the worst. The stark white foam produced is a bad as it gets. It seems to be ever expanding, then it quickly recedes, leaving an uneven and unattractive ""head"" that leaves some sticky, but sporadic glass lacing. Already, it will be shocking if this measures up to the best in the other categories. Foam like this usually indicates barley malt deprived, which isn't good for a proper IPA. The aroma is hoppy enough, in a piney and earthy way; but, no surprise here, there's no scent of malt. Even a good West Coast IPA should have a dose of barley malt. Another sign that things might not be close to optimal here is the near translucence of the standard beer amber. As expected, the mouthfeel is thin, not just light, thin. The taste is average for something that delivers some mild hopping, piney is as good a guess as any, without much starch backing. Even hop lovers will miss the malt counterbalance from this one and quickly move on. This may include barley malt as an ingredient, but not to the level that would salvage this mess.

No starchy foam for a head and although not entirely translucent, it's not close to being cloudy. The color is a beautiful rich amber with an appropriately sized white head. A good sharp hoppy aroma for the nose, good glass lacing and things are going in the right direction. The taste is pleasantly well-hopped without trending to overly bitter. The malt body is perfectly suited to the less than biting hops. It's not sweet at all and somehow compliments the hops, rather than providing a contrast. This goes down so easily for its ABV of 8.5%. This is a great one, with just enough hop character and plenty of alcohol, without being bitter or sweet.

I've been brewing & enjoying IPAs and double IPAs for 12+ years now, and I'm amazed by all of the positive reviews for this beer. Usually a beer with 90 or above on this website is a stellar example of the style. The only reason it has received higher than average marks is due to the high booze content.

Pours a beautiful sheen of translucent deep orange copper topped with multiple fingers of creamy, off-white froth; excellent head retention fades gradually to a generous spread of chunky, soapy lacing, light, fluffy cap, and a steady, tightly-wound collar of froth.

Aroma is bursting with floral notes, candied tangerine, and orange zest upfront, with subtle accents of fresh peach and orange blossom honey guiding into sticky apricot and grapefruit with a touch of malt to close.

Taste offers earthy pine and sticky apricot against refined, resin-soaked malt dominant across the profile; booze-laced grapefruit peel comes into prominence on the back end, while a dirt-laced fresh hop char marks the swallow.

Mouthfeel shows a slightly oily full body and carbonation a shade below medium; a slick, semi-boozy mid-palate warms into a rounded, honey-smooth and lightly sticky finish, leaving a gritty, bitter lingering remaining long past the swallow.

Not one for all occasions, this is an old-school IPA intense in every regard; saturated and just barely self-contained, but I can't help but respect the finesse they managed into such an effectively hoppy brew, potent even as it warms.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/870/25259/,Hopsickle Imperial India Pale Ale,2020,1,29

4336,JZH1000,Colorado,4.05,2023-01-17,"Legacy release 12oz can, canned Sept 12, 2022

On the pour 3 fingers of fine off white head formed that over a few minutes becomes rocky and dissipates to a thick cap that leaves decent lacing. Body is a hazy golden amber.

Smell is more subdued than most modern IPAs let alone an 8%+ IPA. Very spicy and floral hops with some citrus rind coming in on the finish. A touch of caramel malt sweetness.

Taste is crushable, with an immediate smack of bitterness balanced by malt sweetness. The bitterness of the hops fades quickly leaving a nice herbal floral hop flavor with some lingering citrus rind bitterness. The whole time a solid malt backbone carries it through to the finish. Crushable and bright.

Feel is verging on dangerous. Super refreshing to drink with no warning of the ABV until you're feeling it since you probably drank it a little too fast. Despite the easy drinking for an imperial feel, the finish is long woth a full malty body. It's just a really well balanced beer.

Overall, I was impressed. Most of these Avery legacy releases are pretty legit, and are truly old-school ""WCIPAs"". Actual malt backbone, with big but balanced bitterness, and a hop bill that isn't just juice overload.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/30/53167/,DuganA IPA,2023,1,17

When I opened the bottle, the aroma just hit me, it is extremely juicy hoppy - dank, just like its name, reDANKulously hoppy. Zesty, somewhat citrusy, earthy, piney but most of all, dank hops. Almost like a kind of hop honey.
And then comes the taste, you know that trademark red ale feel, very intensive on hops AND malts at the same time. Sweetness and bitterness and juiciness. Exremely good. Some amber ales tend to be a bit overwhelming, but this one, even it is an Imperial one, is drinkable, perfectly well balanced and has absolutely nothing against it. Nothing.
I loved its booziness, it alao hits you in the aroma and slightly in the taste, like a brandy or straight alcohol. Sometimes you need these kinds of drinks, like barley wine.
I had this on the “4th day of Christmas” and it was perfect for the occassion, almost like a winter warmer - without the annoying spice.

4458,Jugs_McGhee,Colorado,2.6,2020-03-18,"12 fl oz pull-tab can acquired as part of a sixer at a beer store in New Orleans, LA via Drizly. Canned 01/06/20.

""Double IPA."" 9.5% ABV. 96.0 IBU. 19,0 SRM. Some online sources that are not Uinta's official site suggest the following: ""Hops: Bravo, Citra, Simcoe. Malts: Munich, C-40""

Served cold.

Caramel. Yogurt (suggestive of Simcoe). Munich malts, sure. Faint alcohol warmth. Bitter orange/orange rind. Subdued pine.

I don't love the hop profile, and it's a bit too warm alcohol-wise as well as too full-bodied and heavy on the palate. Caramel malts are emphasized more than the hops and their concomitant bitterness, leading to a beer that while not egregiously imbalanced fails to showcase hop varietals instead of malts - at least to the extent that an Imperial IPA needs to.

Drinkable but far from great...I hoped for better from Uinta but its pricing isn't awful. I can't imagine ever wanting to pick this up over a widely distributed, cheaper, and better expression of the style like Lagunitas Sucks, let alone superior regional and seasonal stabs at the style.

I guess I'm glad this is available in a market like Utah's where higher alcohol craft beers are less ubiquitous, but it won't impress those familiar with the modern imperial IPA. I don't see any potential here and don't think the recipe can be tweaked to save it.

Underwhelming.

Aroma:
Spicy/sweet notes of spruce needles and burnt citrus peel. Some hints of tropical pineapple and tangy, slightly tart mango. Some minor, but still perceptible notes of cantaloupe and honeydew in there as well.

Taste:
Clean notes of honeydew melon and mango upfront. Savory / tangy flavors of pineapple puree and malt driven notes of freshly baked banana bread. Brief flash of caramel and toffee. Bitter throughout but not aggressively so - there's a nice flavor of pine sap, orange peel and tree resin blanketing the entire experience - it's just enough so as to keep the beer from being too tropical and sweet. 

Feel:
Creamy and smooth. The beer feels a lot less carbonated than the appearance lets on. Alcohol profile is low, especially for an 8.5%er but still apparent. Astringency is mild, but works well with the beers texture and flavor.

4628,LiquidAmber,Washington,4.2,2023-10-01,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a lightly hazy, light to medium golden amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of pale malt, citrus and tropical fruit hops; somewhat subdued. Flavor is pale and biscuit malt, citrus, piney and fruit hops, lemon grapefruit, mixed stone fruit, green melon and light pine Piney finish with light resin and citrus bitterness. Medium bodied with moderate creaminess, nice mouth feel. Another East Coast IPA that looked and smelled like it might lean too far to the fruit profile, but the taste had a lot of West Coast citrus and pine character. This IPA seems to take a few things from a number of styles; a little biscuit in malt from old time IPAs, but mostly more current pale malts; pine and citrus from the West Coast, but interesting light fruit leaning east. The oat component in the malt gives it a pleasant mouth feel. The whole IPA comes together nicely with a solid bitterness in the finish. I liked this quite a bit. This can had a few months on it, which may have reduces the brightness of the hops, but it was still fine.

The aroma is still not available to me, beginning to wonder if it will ever come back.
The taste though, lovely tropical fruit flavors wash over the tongue before the dankness kicks in at the swallow. I had to take multiple gulps to verify this was the pattern and, for me at least, it was. Malts likely played a role in there somewhere but it was all about the hops.
The feel was just weighty enough to carry the ABV, and the flavors were certainly mouth filling.

16oz can dated 05/18/23, served in a big snifter. Provided by @roguer in a LIF associated with NBS BIF #17. Long time want, unexpected got.

Pours a hazy orange tilting a little bit toward golden. Initial pour had a fairly modest head, maybe a bit less than a centimeter, which dissipated into a thick and fairly even skin that retains its boundaries about a centimeter above the surface of the beer. Smell is tropical, mango and pineapple, very ripe, approaching overripe. A little bit of an orange blossom sweetness.

Taste is right in the same channel, juicy and easily avoids over-sweetness, nice bitterness, orange rind in nature, pretty strong, I think providing the counterbalance to all the juicy stuff going on.

Mouthfeel is medium with a hint of grittiness. Overall, this is a really nice, really well-built beer.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/27710/140460/,Captain's Daughter,2023,7,8

Violent burst of alcohol, ethers and pine wrapped around a mango with a slice of pineapple.
The aroma is followed by the same type of aromatic assault, but this time the initial sweetness fades to a dry and fruity taste that show all we can expect from what was initially billed as a "" Quadruple IPA"".
At the time this review was written the beer community had not been exposed to many beers of this style / ABV so it would be hard to compare.
The booziness is not just evident, it pounds your palate, but it does finish rather smoothly.
There are some medicinal notes with a minor bitter after taste and a touch of a syrupy note.
Balance is way off for me. Why make this beer ?
It is not a classic and it is just a boozy excuse of time and energy.

Flavor is insanely bitter at first, lots of dry pine resin and spruce oil - it's earthy + spicy - almost hot and peppery which maybe why Evil Twin calls this ""Molotov cocktail"" I'm guessing. The spicy resin flavors turn fruity just briefly as some sweet tropical mango and orange comes through, then it gets back into more bitter flavors with a sort of rye-bread & toasted pumpernickel malt flavor. Aftertaste of bittersweet orange peel and spicy pine resin, as well as a clean soothing, warming alcohol aftertaste.

Speaking of apricot, the aroma is mostly reminiscent of fruit. It's not particularly pungent. There's an appealing dryness that runs the entire tasting. It isn't fruity at all. Earthy piney is the best taste reference. It's not layered and there's not much taste transition, even during the finish. Nor need there be. There's sufficient malt for the body, but it adds to the earthiness rather than adding any sweetness. 
Although there's only scant glass lacing, this is very, very good, overall. But, to think so, you'll need to enjoy a very bitter and dry hoppy taste.

Taste carries a nice mild malty sweet presence that the nose does not hint at…after that the orange like fruitiness, and the sap bites on the finish; dank in aftertaste. 

Medium body, prickling sappy bite immediately upon each sip that just coats the whole tongue; it then finishes incredibly dry with another wallop of hops in the form of substantial bitterness.

Taste is pretty extreme bitterness. Like I haven't tasted in quite some time. Pine and intense grapefruit zest. If I pay attention, there's some sweetness that flashes across the palate before the bitterness strikes. It might be kind of a honey / floral.

This is a delicious, malty beer that hits every note an IPA should. It's god a beautiful red color and after the pour (you really need to drink this from a glass) the head stays and stays and stays. Being a double IPA it has an excellent hoppy flavor and finish and there is even a hint of sweetness on the back end.

I am trying to figure out what exactly is so awful about the taste. It occured to me it tastes like chlorine, which I'm very familiar with from having to filter tap water (Denver, you don't know how good you have it). But also sugar cane, old oranges, boiled broccoli, and on the bright side, candied grapefruit peel. 

On top of everything it's astoundingly bitter, more like aspirin than hops. I can't think what people find drinkable about this, unless it's another case of Total Wine buying cheap lots of badly stored beer and then aging them on their usual warm shelves.

Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden orange color with a small head of white foam. The head fades very rapidly, leaving a touch of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is heavy of a caramel malt and bready aroma mixed with bit of harvest fruit and grain. Along with these smells comes a decent showing of a pine and herbal smell as well as a touch of grapefruit hop.
Taste – The taste begins with a malty bready and slightly grainy flavor that is paired with a decent showing of earthy hops. At the same time there is a little bit of caramel, pear, and apple, with the three all lessening as the taste moves forward on the tongue. While the sweet dwindles the hops increase with more earthy flavors being joined by some pine and a touch of floral hop. Toward the end the pine surges, leaving one with a malty and somewhat more resinously hopped taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thick and chewy with a moderate carbonation level. For the malty and more resinous flavors the feel is good and makes for a nice slow sipper.
Overall – A rather nice, none citrus laden, double with great drinkability and an overall nice hop blend.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/30437/88207/,Road 2 Ruin,2023,7,12

Taste: There is a noticeable hops flavor, as expected from an American IPA. There is good bite from the hops along with other flavors like citrus, but the hops bitterness is not overpowering. This is not as bitter as some other American IPAs, and there is a little sweetness. The aftertaste provides a variety of flavors over time. Not overly bitter or hoppy, and has a nice balance.

Smell is apricot, mellon, caramel, biscuit, and a little grapefruit. 

Taste apricot, bubblegum, biscuit, caramel, and a little more grapefruit in the finish.

Mouthfeel is pretty big for the style, nice amount of life, not really dry, and besides the rather odd pairings of flavors, pretty approachable for its size.

5178,MacMalt,New Jersey,3.94,2016-05-21,"I had this on draught in a pub. It was served in a pint glass. It pours a hazy copper color with a thin, khaki-colored head and lacing. For an IPA, the smell is surprisingly malty and there is a distinct aroma of ripe fruit. The taste was totally unexpected: it's quite sweet with ripe strawberry and a lot of caramel up front and a slight bitter hoppy taste at the finish. It is also surprisingly malty. It's a medium-bodied ale, lightly carbonated, and the 9.43% ABV is noticeable but not overwhelming. Overall, this is, to me, a unique Double IPA, the sweet fruit and malt being prevalent. I really enjoyed it. I would like to try this one in a bottle and at a warmer temperature.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/394/20470/,Double IPA 1,2016,5,21
5179,reverendsteveii,Pennsylvania,4.01,2016-03-16,"Got bottles at a local quick six, served a chilled pint glass. A caveat, I'm an IPA man, and this is my first double/imperial IPA review.

Color - Dirty blonde tending to copper, cloudy and opaque like a Hefe, but darker in color. A middle ground between a hefe weizen and an IPA.

Nose - Very malty, very hot, corn/bourbon note, hops not very forward

Head - White with a touch of coloration from the beer, airy, recedes after about a minute, but leaves eavy lacing

Mouthfeel - Heavy and thick, but just hoppy and strong enough to not leave the mouth feeling 'coated' as with barleywines and other strong beers. Middling-light carbonation, a bit creamy.

Taste - Opens v sweet, v hot, almost overwhelming. hops add crisp but slightly soapy finish (simcoe?). On second sip, detecting chocolate, coffee and caramel notes.

Impression: The first sip is half vodka half corn syrup, with a touch of caramel. The second sip is a little less surprising in its boldness, and you begin to notice the hops in the finish. On the third sip, the hops become more pronounced (perhaps the sweetness taste buds on your tongue have taken a well-deserved break) and you begin to realize there's some complexity here, but the hops also come quite close to being chemical in their bitterness. The caramel gives way to coffee and chocolate, which compliment the bitter finish brilliantly. This one's a grower, and I didn't care for it at first. The depth, however, is surprising. 

This beer is an example of a genre I don't normally care for, but has a uniqueness that makes it stand out compared to other beers in this style. 85%, an excellent proof of the fact that high gravity doesn't mean a simplistic malt nightmare,",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/394/20470/,Double IPA 1,2016,3,16

Triple kicks off with spicy dank hops followed by ripe pineapple and grapefruit pith that ends with that wonderful resinous sticky finish.

5532,dano213,Pennsylvania,3.93,2023-03-29,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $4.50. Canned on 021523, which means that this is one day shy of six weeks old.

Look: It has a thick haze and it is a deep yellowish/orangish color. Kind of looks like turkey gravy but not as thick or dark-colored. There was a rocky head that left behind a beige-colored ring and very thin layer of tiny bubbles. The head regenerates nicely after swirling, but it doesn't stick around long.

Smell: Lots of citrus and tropical notes - grapefruit, orange rind, pineapple, melon. There's also definitely some green notes here. Piney. Slightly chalky on the nose. Green bell pepper on the finish after swirling the glass.

Taste: Pretty tasty. This does not really remind me much of Daisy Cutter Pale Ale, but it is good nonetheless. It has a soft, juicy, sweet taste up front, but the finish is decidedly bitter but doesn't linger very long. As I mention below, it's quite drinkable. To me, it's just lacking a bit of a hook in that it has some interesting aspects but overall it lacks a ""fun factor"" or complexity / overall interestingness.

Feel: Soft mouthfeel with a sharp, bitter finish. The carbonation is nice and this beer is medium plus bodied. For a 8% hazy double pale ale, it has high drinkability.

Overall: This beer looks hazy and you could easily think that this is going to be a NEIPA, but it's more West-Coast IPA and its core Daisy Cutter bitterness really shines. While I like aspects of this beer, there's just something about it that is not doing it for me. I am not really enjoying drinking this beer that much, which is strange because I tend to enjoy almost all Half Acre beers. I would much rather have a regular Daisy Cutter Pale Ale.

Appearance: Pours a nearly completely hazy (10% clarity), medium to deep orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 9. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong and juicy aromas of orange, melon. Earthy and soapy. Some hints of citrus flower, but earthy and black tea lingers. 

Flavor: Strong and sweet flavors of orange citrus, orange creamsicle, some cotton candy and tropical pineapple juice. Earthy and dank melon and berries linger with a black tea flavor. Sweet and juicy with a mild to moderate bitterness. 

Compared to Hop Butcher The Jewels 7/23/22: Pours a darker, clearer color. Stronger, danker aromas. More orange, earthy and dank melon and berries. Less pineapple and citrus flower. More earthy tea. Sweeter and more resinous. 

Overall: A robust Pale Ale here. As others have said it sort of meddles between a NE and WC. Leans hazy with the juiciness, but has the resinous and dank WC flavors. Not too bitter though. Leans sweet and resinous to give it that double pale ale sweetness and malt quality. Good stuff, a bit too sweet for my liking, but still enjoyable.

16 fl. oz. can coded ""03/17/22C 2758 15:22 FULLY LOADED"" and sampled om 07/07/22
$7.49 @ Foodery Beer, Phila., PA

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's a hazy one! It's cloudy like a hefeweizen, and pretty much the same golden with orange in color. The head is a finger's width of slightly yellowed off-white foam. The aroma is resinous, or ""dank"", with citrusy and otherwise tropical fruits behind it. I'm definitely getting some orange and grapefruit but I'm not sure what else is there so let's taste it and see. Mmmm, that's pretty good. It's a solid ""DOUBLE PALE ALE"" at 8.2% ABV and the alcohol is evident. It's also firmly bitter so don't think you're getting a juicy NEIPA with this one. On top of that the malt has some character to it. It's grainy and biscuity and lightly caramelish. OK, back to the hop notes, I'm getting floral like lillies, orange, pine, grapefruit, passionfruit, berry, dried herbs, and a peppery spiciness but that might be at least partially from the alcohol. It finishes dry with the peppery spiciness and herbs (oregano, dull anise) lingering. In the mouth it's medium-full in body and crisp. This is an IPA drinker's ""double pale ale"" to be sure!

A: A soapy and washy dull ivory head is patchy and thin atop a dark, opaque orange colored body. Tons of macro-bubbly carbonation within with slight sticky treads of lace. 

S: Lemon and lime, reminds me of a mexican lager. Some outliners of cantaloupe, pretty decent strength level. Solid good with some dank oranges coming on the finish. 

T: Flavor was tart, of musky oranges, and lemons. Dry musky cobwebs adds a yeasty flair with some bitter stale hops on the finish. Has a good deal of alcohol awareness on the swallow, solvent like. Caramel orange specialty grains provide the backbone.

M: Crackly carbonation, good chewy base malts. Speciality grains provide the back bone with a compliment of dry powdery stale hops coating on the tongue. 

O: Overall not sure of date, but the finish of solvent like alcohol maybe was intended due to name, but was a bit much regardless. Im guessing they called it a Moltov for good reason.

5654,Ozzylizard,Pennsylvania,4.12,2023-04-29,"Knuckle Sandwich from Bootlegger’s Brewery. 16 fl oz can from @2beerdogs in NBW BIF 17. Reviewed 29/04/23 (Review 3086). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Bottom of can stamped “02/17/2023”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 47.4 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 55.2 degrees F. 
Appearance – 4.25
First pour – Medium Amber (SRM 12), clear.
Body – Deep orange amber (SRM ?), opaque. Under direct light, looks like cider sans precipitate. When rear lite, translucent orange amber.
Head: Large (Maximum 4.7 cm, aggressive center pour), fulvous, high density, average retention, slowly retreating, leaving a 1.6 – 2.0 cm crown with an undulating upper rim and a complete rocky layer. After a couple of minutes exposed to air, the crown lightens from fulvous to between beige and wheat.
Lacing – Fair. Medium wide smooth three-dimensional band of tiny to small bubbles.
Aroma – 4 – Primarily hops – grapefruit rind and a bit of orange, no malt, no yeast. No ethanol (10 % ABV as marked on the label) aroma. 
Flavor – 4 – Follows the nose – mild grapefruit with a bit of malt balancing the finish. Neither yeast nor ethanol. Very weak gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 4 – Full; just short of creamy; lively but soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5 Very drinkable DIPA – the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts! If this were available locally, I’d have a few four-packs on hand.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/17271/54745/,Knuckle Sandwich,2023,4,29
5655,BillAfromSoCal,California,4.58,2020-10-14,"16 oz can dated 9/02/20 bought off a room temp shelf at trader Joes on about 10/5/20 then refrigerated until poured into a large tulip glass on 10/13. Deep amber color with just a little bit of haze and a little less than 1 finger thick creamy off-white to light tan head. Lots of thick lacing. Fairly aggressive malt and hop fragrance but in line with expectations for a good DIPA. Malt-forward flavor but with really good hop balance. Nice chewy, viscous mouthfeel but zero alcohol burn, despite the 10% ABV. I probably would rank this higher than 4.5 overall but the 10% ABV in a 16 oz can is like drinking 3.2 OZ of your favorite 100 proof whiskey. I would strongly prefer this in a 12 oz offering if I have to do anything constructive afterward.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/17271/54745/,Knuckle Sandwich,2020,10,14
5656,ovaltine,Indiana,4.29,2019-12-01,"Crystal clear copper color with a light tan head, this old school DIPA features citrus and piney hop aromas, and a significant caramalt aroma. Wow.

The citrus and pine are balanced perfectly on the taste, but it’s the slightly sweet caramalt that is the linchpin in this beer, masking the significant ABV (10%), making this dangerously drinkable. 

The mouthfeel is a bit oily, but not cloying, an impressive feat in a big DIPA. I’d drink this until it came out my ears - and then take a nap. Love it.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/17271/54745/,Knuckle Sandwich,2019,12,1
5657,Lingenbrau,Oregon,4.25,2019-11-22,"Big thanks to Derek for the can. It's been at least 5 years since I've had the pleasure.

Much more red than I remember. A deep amber hue with wonderful clarity. A thin light khaki head lies above leaving behind minimal spots of lacing.

My daughter initial impression and much to my memory, this thing is bursting with sweet smelling pine sap. And oxymoron of sorts, I guess. Anyhoo, digging in a bit more, a bit if burnt rubber, which is something I've always gotten with certain hop varieties. Especially Chinook. A pinch of dried grapefruit rind creeps in as well.

Flavor bursts with damp evergreen and citrus, much to what the aroma would indicate. Touches of caramel. Got a little spicy thing going on too. Very nice.

A little slick, but still smooth and dry enough of a finish to allow for bigger sips. Dangerous, considering the elevated abv. Obviously bitter, but sweet enough to perceive well balanced.

Not exactly what I remember from the Fullerton classic. A fine brew either way, and it hits you right in the kisser, as any proper knuckle sammich should. Cheers.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/17271/54745/,Knuckle Sandwich,2019,11,22

Odd that it's been around for 7 years and I've never run in to it, because I am at the brewery in Chico at least twice a year going way back and thought I knew their line well. Poured in to a regular pint beer glass, thin head, little lacing, and a good light amber color. Strange nose, which has a bit of a 'nut brown' ale in my opinion (hops). Taste front end is hoppy; Very Magnum hoppy in my opinion, and they went a bit foreward with those hops and the bitterness sticks around for a while, you will be still tasting this one for a while after you put it down. If you are a Magnum fan, then you will love this. It has the solid Pine/Grapefruit base going, and the Sierra Nevada trademark trademark taste. It is a bit refreshing. If you are new to IPA's then this will not likely be your choice, because the bitterness could ruin your face. It's a bit malty without being chewy, and it does a nice job of hiding the ABV. But the hops that SN put in here are premium. If you are a fan of the Magnum hop, and can get this fresh, then jump on it.

A fluffy foam makes a momentary presence, but leaves for parts unknown, quickly. Spongy lacing hovers on the top quarter of the glass.,
Nose is dank, sure, but lots of malt pokes through. 
Taste is all 8% ABV alcohol forward, eliminating any fine nuances the sud has to offer. This Frankenbeer has an O.D. of bittering hops and more ‘dust’ than needed. The brewer is trying too hard to blow me away, IMO., Patience allows my palate to pick up what’s being laid down., and it feels forced. Alchemy.,.
Mouth is thin, low end of medium carbonation.

5710,ryan1788a5,Massachusetts,4.05,2024-01-27,"12oz can poured into a snifter.

A: Golden-amber color with great clarity. Rocky off-white head initially rises to a three finger height before settling to a very respectable one after good time has passed. Lacing clings in chunky sheets. 

S: Dank AF. Green and herbal/earthy with a big dose of catty lemon. Freshly broken spruce needles. Big oily pine resin. Maybe some orange gummy wedges and candied grapefruit in the background. Some background toast and caramel and a faint graininess from the malt. It basically smells like sticking your face into a mixed bag of pac northwest hop pellets. 

T: Spruce tips open things, with a quick backing of lemon peel and candied grapefruit. The pine and resin loop back and double down with a bitterness that slowly and steadily clamps down on the palate until you're considering a tap-out. Herbal, catty, spicy, oily. All the most challenging and in-your-face west coast hop flavor is unapologetically here. Malt base is caramel, toast, and raw honey. Spicy alcohol and black pepper. Lingering caramel malt sweetness and a fat wallop of pine sol (in the best way) on the finish.

M: Thick and round with a real sense of heft in the mouth. The weight is there, but not at all oppressive. Gritty and enamel-raking hop astringency. Spicy alcohol. Ample carbonation adds a bit of lift and bite.

O: Holy shit. This is a throwback to the golden ages of west coast IPA dominance. I feel like I'm drinking the Arnold/Billy Dee Williams bicep-bulging hand clasp scene from The Predator. There is such a ridiculous amount of raw hop flavor here that I really don't think the modern NEIPA drinker will be able to last a single sip. More than anything, it feels like a love letter to a bygone era, when dryness and piney/citrusy bitterness were the norm in the IPA world. Personally I miss that era and love these trips down memory lane, but then again I am very much the target audience for this beer. All the kids should at least try it, because in my day we had to walk to school even when there was three feet of snow on the ground, and they should know how delicious that experience was.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/140/291222/,Hop Bullet,2024,1,27

Aroma: Cream of wheat with a very light toasted peanut note and a hint of sweet orange / savory mango in the background.

Taste: Light bittersweet tropical flavor - with an underlying creaminess. Upfront, the flavor is reminiscent of peaches and cream. It transitions quickly into flavors of bitter orange rind midpalate, before ending on floral notes of raw honeycomb. Alcohol profile is non existent.

Feel: Medium bodied with low carbonation. For lack of a better term ""slick"" due to the low of effervescence on the palate. 

Overall: A soothing, creamy but not overtly thick - sort of night cap style double IPA that will lull you into comfort. Not boozy or punchy. Pine and citrus peel flavors compliment the peach / mango flavors very well.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/140/291222/,Hop Bullet,2023,1,31

5832,Blogjackets,Ohio,4.28,2023-07-23,"Poured from a pint can, the body is an opaque brown-orange. Good initial head and solid lacing throughout the tasting. Nice appearance. 

A pineapple forward nose and a melange of hoppy goodness. This beer has a kitchen sink of hops.

Taste up front is bitter hop bite later balanced somewhat by a sturdy malt backbone. Despite the initial bite, the bitterness quickly retreats. No sign of the high ABV.

Carbonation is good. The mouthfeel is smooth and unexpectedly dries up nicely.

At 10% ABV and 100 IBUs, one might view this beer as extreme. A fair comp might be to Resin by Sixpoint (8.1% and 103 IBUs) given similar stats, but this beer is quite balanced (though still listing to bitter) and is very drinkable.

5836,maximum12,Minnesota,3.81,2022-04-13,"My 23rd review of a Revolution beer & it won’t be my last (unless I stop a semi tomorrow). 16 oz. can & the first Revolution I bought at my local here in MN. Woohoo!

The pour is like old-school IPA porn a sharp, wistful gold clearer than Charlize Theron’s complexion. The nose is bitter pine, hopefully mirrored in what I’m about to ingest. 

Unsessionable sounds like a challenge. The taste is indeed full of north woods pine along with serious throat-clearing firewater & plenty of tropical fruit but more citrus than…NE IPA. Juicy might be more accurate & as a taste, not a genre. Caramel malt before a harsh, welcome bitterness cleans up the joint. Thick for an IPA & despite the big ABV it is, dare I say, a brew I could have more than one of. 

This is lovely. It doesn’t quite reach the seats but it’s definitely off the wall. Very good brew.",https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22072/138418/,Unsessionable,2022,4,13

I found the smell punguent, not bright but not dank. Tangerine, blood orange and some pine were noticed. 

On tasting the first impression was very well balanced. It may be high ABV, high IBU but the alcohol and bitterness took a back seat to the flavors, malt, tart fruit and pine. The bitterness lasts throughout but is never dominating. In some ways the balance hurts the flavor as none shine particularly bright.
